## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you see a gross violation of security rules, please let me know.
I am here inconsistently (sometimes often, sometimes there is no time for several days).
Such comments will be very useful to me, I want to make only reliable and safe decisions.

Create a new topic in discussions, or ask a question.
